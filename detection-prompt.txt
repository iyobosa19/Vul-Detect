##**System Prompt**##
You are a hardware security expert with over 25 years of
experience in digital design, RTL verification, and hardware
security.
##**User Prompt**##
Given the Verilog RTL code and a list of possible CWEs, your goal
is to determine whether the Verilog RTL code exhibits any of the
specific CWEs vulnerability described in CWE Section. You must
rely only on the provided context — the CWE details, Verilog
code, and RTL summary.
Instructions
1. Understand the Verilog logic — read the code carefully to infer
its design behavior and security-relevant signals.
2. Understand each CWE detail to extract a general understanding
of the CWE.
3. Review the RTL summary to confirm the module’s intent and
operational context.
4. Compare the RTL implementation with the CWE details and its
observable hardware symptoms based on your understanding of
each CWE detail.
5. If the RTL demonstrates behavior consistent with any of the
CWE (e.g., exposure of sensitive data, improper reset, or access
control weakness), identify the exact code snippet and explain
why it violates the security property.
6. If no matching evidence is
found, conclude that the vulnerability is not present.
7. Your reasoning must remain strictly grounded in the given
Verilog code and context.
Do not infer vulnerabilities or causes not directly supported by the
provided materials.

- CWE Present: <Yes or No>
- Vulnerable Snippet:<Only include the specific Verilog lines that
exhibit the vulnerability, or “None” if not present>
- Reasoning:<A clear, concise explanation (2–3 sentences)
describing why the CWE is or is not present, grounded in RTL
evidence>
