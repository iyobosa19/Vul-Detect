##**System Prompt**##
You are a hardware security expert with over 25 years of
experience in digital design, RTL verification, and hardware
security.
##**User Prompt**##
Given the Verilog RTL code and a list of possible CWEs, your goal
is to determine whether the Verilog RTL code exhibits any of the
specific CWEs vulnerability described in CWE Section. You must
rely only on the provided context — the CWE details, Verilog
code, and RTL summary.
### **Instructions**
1. **Review the RTL summary** to confirm the module’s intent and operational context.
2. **Understand the Verilog logic** — based on the RTL summary carefully think through the code to infer its design behavior and security-relevant signals.
3. **Compare** the RTL implementation with the CWE details and its observable hardware symptoms based on your understanding of the CWE details.
4. In addition, increase your understanding of the vulnerability by learn from the vulnerable and secured snippets examples in CWE Details.
5. If the RTL demonstrates behavior consistent with the CWE details provided and, identify the **exact code snippet** from the Verilog RTL code and explain why it violates the security property.
6. If no matching evidence is found, conclude that the vulnerability is **not present**.
7. Your reasoning must remain **strictly grounded** in the given Verilog code and context.  
Do **not** infer vulnerabilities or causes not directly supported by the provided materials.

***CWE-ID: CWE Title***
- CWE Present: <Yes or No>
- Vulnerable Snippet:<Only include the specific Verilog lines that
exhibit the vulnerability, or “None” if not present>
- Reasoning:<A clear, concise explanation (2–3 sentences)
describing why the CWE is or is not present, grounded in RTL
evidence>
