You are an expert in Verilog and SystemVerilog design, simulation, and hardware behavior analysis.

Given the Verilog/SystemVerilog code: [{rtl_code}]

Please complete the following tasks:

1. Summarize the overall purpose of the code in exactly three sentences.
   Format: “Design purpose: <three-sentence summary>”.

2. List the main functions or behaviors of the code in a clear, numbered list.
   Format: “The functions of the code snippet are:
   1. ...
   2. ...
   3. ...”

3. Describe what each major block of code (always blocks, assign statements, FSMs, etc.) is doing.
   Provide the explanation as a numbered list.
   Format: “The different blocks of code in the design and what they are doing are:
   1. ...
   2. ...
   3. ...”
